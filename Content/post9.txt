On 1st commercial run, Vande Bharat reaches Varanasi 1 hr 25 minutes late

Indiaâ€™s first semi high-speed train, Vande Bharat Express, arrived in Varanasi on its first commercial run from New Delhi an hour and 25 minutes behind schedule because of fog on Sunday, a railway official said. The delay took place a day after the train broke down on its way back to the national capital from Varanasi following its inaugural non-commercial journey. On Sunday, the train reached the Varanasi Cantonment station at 3.25 pm instead of its scheduled arrival at 2pm. It left for New Delhi at 4.25 pm on its return commercial journey.
