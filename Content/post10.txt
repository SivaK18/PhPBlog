Chinnathambi to be captured and sent to elephant camp: TN Forest dept to HC

The Tamil Nadu Forest Department on Monday informed the Madras High Court that wild elephant Chinnathambi will be captured and sent to an elephant camp. Sanjay Kumar Srivastava, the Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), appeared in the court on behalf of the Tamil Nadu Forest Department following a petition filed by wildlife activist Arun Prasanna. In his petition, Arun had requested the court to order the department to not convert Chinnathambi into a kumki elephant.
